# webCrawler
Just a simple web crawler using javascript & node

To test the functions during development we can use a testing tool called *`jest`*.

```
npm install --save-dev jest
```

Test it using 
```
npm test
```

To get URL's from HTML we need a dependency called *`jsdom`*.
```
npm install jsdom
```
